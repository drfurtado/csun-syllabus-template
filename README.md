# CSUN Syllabus Templates

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** When opening the generated .docx files in Microsoft Word, you may see a message asking "This document contains fields that may refer to other files. Do you want to update the fields in this document?" This is normal and expected due to the table of contents. Click "Yes" to ensure all document fields are up to date.

üìö **Important:** Before using these templates, please review the content of the this [website](https://w2.csun.edu/educational-policies-committee/resources/syllabus-best-practices) which contains a collection of resources from Academic First Year Experiences and Faculty Development regarding best practices for creating a high-quality syllabus.

‚ö†Ô∏è **alert:** This repository was created and maintained by [Dr. Furtado](https://drfurtado.github.io/site/). If you find any discrepancy between these templates and existing published official templates from CSUN, please open an issue on this repository. I will review and update the templates as needed.

This repository contains syllabus templates for California State University, Northridge (CSUN) faculty members, designed to meet all Faculty Senate requirements.
