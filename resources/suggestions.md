ðŸ“Œ Advice
Do not assume students are technology experts. Although they may appear digitally savvy, it does not mean they have the digital literacy skills to be able to successfully navigate an online learning environment. Furthermore, (and unfortunately) not all faculty use Canvas in the same way, so for students this makes it especially challenging to navigate.
Be as detailed as possible in clarifying your expectations for students and any instructions about the course structure or the use of technology. In a fully or mostly online class, students will likely not have direct access to you or receive an explanation of the syllabus in class.
Humanize your syllabus. If your students have ever told you something like, "you're nothing like your syllabus" then pay attention to this disconnect, especially for online courses.
